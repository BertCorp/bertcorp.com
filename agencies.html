			<h1>Hello. We are BertCorp.</h1>
			<img src="img/logo.png" style="width: 100px;">
			<h3>We want to help you make more money.</h3>
		</div>
		
		<p>You've finished with a client project. What now? Do you have a maintenance or support plan going forward? Your client doesn't have a "web guy" or a trusted technical advisor that they can turn to, and it's not worth it for you to staff someone full time to handle odd client requests. But you know the client will have a wide range of exactly that: odd requests for ongoing needs and questions. Are they on their own?</p>

		<p>They don't have to be.</p>


		<h2>What We Offer</h2>
		<p>A monthly Support Retainer that includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>General web maintenance and support requests</li>
			<li>Bug fixes and troubleshooting for:
				<ul>
		    	<li>Front-end (HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript/jQuery)</li>
		    	<li>Back-end (PHP, WordPress, Ruby/Rails)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Expert advice on:
				<ul>
		    	<li>"What is X service/tool?"</li>
		    	<li>"I have Y problem. What are my options?"</li>
					<li>"I need Z. Where and how do I get it?"</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Quality Assurance, Testing, and Site Monitoring</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>The Benefits To Your Clients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Your client doesn't feel abandoned or tossed aside (they feel cared for and appreciated).</li>
			<li>No need to hire someone in-house (saving them $60k+ every year).</li>
			<li>You provide a reliable place for them to turn with their questions.</li>
			<li>We respond to all questions, bugs, and concerns within 24-hours â€” and 99% of issues are resolved within 48-hours.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>The Benefits To You</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>No more headaches (or wasting billable hours) helping clients answer minor/simple questions.</li>
			<li>We are a reminder to clients that you are the place to turn for their needs.</li>
			<li>We help your clients get back to making more money so they have more money to spend with you in the future.</li>
			<li>Clients are thankful to you for taking care of them, no matter the size of their needs. They will think better of you in the long run and come back more often when they have future projects (we will gladly remind them of what a great job you did last time).</li>
			<li>We help you maintain happy and healthy relationships after your job is done. And happy clients are more likely to recommend you to friends.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Is there a white-label option?</h3>
		<p>Yes. While we prefer to be transparent that we are a separate partner company, we are not opposed to working under your brand and establishing a protocol for working with you and your team if it is beneficial to the client.</p>
